# Vinea++
Scrapes all info from mijnreisleiding.nl using your Vinea login credentials. Then displays the data better.

## Development
1. Install yarn
2. Run `yarn` in the root
3. Run `yarn start`
4. Visit `localhost:6363`
5. Not working? Ask me for help ;-)

## Deployment
Create a `deploy.sh` file in the root and add whatever you want there to deploy. It is `.gitignore`d so won't be committed to this repo.
